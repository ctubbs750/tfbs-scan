Building DAG of jobs...
Your conda installation is not configured to use strict channel priorities. This is however crucial for having robust and correct environments (for details, see https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/tipsandtricks.html). Please consider to configure strict priorities by executing 'conda config --set channel_priority strict'.

[Mon Jan 15 16:47:40 2024]
Job 1: 
        Splits masked genome by chromsome from parallel scanning.
        
Reason: Missing output files: results/tfbs-scan/hg38/mask/chr1.fa; Code has changed since last execution

RuleException in rule sequence_split_genome in file /panfs/accrepfs.vampire/data/ruderferlab/projects/biovu/cnv/cre/CTCF-Variant-Annotation/snakemake/workflows/common/tfbs-scan/workflow/rules/sequence.smk, line 91:
NameError: The name 'line' is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}, when formatting the following:

        #faidx --regex "{params.chromosome}" --out {output} {input}
        #csplit -s -z {input} '/>/' '{{*}}' -f {params.output_dir}
        while read line
        do
            if [[ ${line:0:1} == '{params.chromosome}' ]]
            then
                outfile=${{line#>}}.fa
                echo $line > {output}
            else
                echo $line >> {output}
            fi
        done < {input}
