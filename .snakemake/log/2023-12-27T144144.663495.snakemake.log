Building DAG of jobs...
Your conda installation is not configured to use strict channel priorities. This is however crucial for having robust and correct environments (for details, see https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/tipsandtricks.html). Please consider to configure strict priorities by executing 'conda config --set channel_priority strict'.

Job 10: 
        Installs target genome(s) under install dir
        - Regex to filter down to main chromosomes
        - Default provider set to UCSC
        
Reason: Missing output files: resources/data/genome/hg38/hg38.fa.gz; Code has changed since last execution; Params have changed since last execution

MissingOutputException in rule genome_install_genome in file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctubbs750/genome/main/workflow/Snakefile, line 21:
Job 10  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
resources/data/genome/hg38/hg38.fa.gz
Removing output files of failed job genome_install_genome since they might be corrupted:
resources/data/genome/hg38/hg38.blacklist.bed, resources/data/genome/hg38/hg38.gaps.bed
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
