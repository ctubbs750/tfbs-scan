Workflow defines that rule genome_genome_install_genome is eligible for caching between workflows (use the --cache argument to enable this).
Lints for rule scan_test_parallel (line 33, /panfs/accrepfs.vampire/data/ruderferlab/projects/biovu/cnv/cre/CTCF-Variant-Annotation/snakemake/workflows/common/tfbs-scan/workflow/rules/scan.smk):
    * No log directive defined:
      Without a log directive, all output will be printed to the terminal. In distributed environments,
      this means that errors are harder to discover. In local environments, output of concurrent jobs
      will be mixed and become unreadable.

    * Specify a conda environment or container for each rule.:
      This way, the used software for each specific step is documented, and the workflow can be
      executed on any machine without prerequisites.
